## Problem Statement
As the digital landscape for urban culture home salon services continues to evolve, our app successfully provides convenient skincare solutions.

## Features
- **Skincare Routine Recording**: Users should be able to log their daily skincare routine, comprising five essential steps: face wash, toner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and lip balm. The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to effortlessly input their routine with minimal friction.
- **Streak Tracking**: A streak mechanism will be integrated to incentivize consistent skincare habits. Users who record their skincare routines daily will maintain a streak. The longer the streak, the more rewards and recognition users will receive.
